18-35 year old subjects with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated
in an fMRI experiment to look at modulations in the PPA area when seeing
patterns of repetions in scene imagery. they lay in a Allegra 3T scanner with a
mirror on the head coil reflecting projected stimuli. TR length was 1.5s. 6s of
rest were allotted at the start of the experiment, to allow the scanner signal
to settle. subjects were allowed one minute of rest between each task.

subjects fixated on a dot in the center of the screen, and viewed an
uninterrupted stream of scene images. on each trial, subjects were shown a photo
of a scene for 0.5s. subjects had 1.3s from the time the photo was shown to
indicate whether the scene was indoor or outdoor. the next trial began 0.2s
later, with the start of the next TR. subjects did this task in two separate
runs. each run lasted 355 TRs, totalling about 10 minutes.
